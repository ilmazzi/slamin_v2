        <p class="mb-4">When creating an event, in the <strong>Invitations & settings</strong> section, you can create a gig. A gig is a job offer, a participation request, in short, the best way to allow people to take part as protagonists in your event.</p>
        
        <p class="mb-4">If you need artists or technical support, MCs or other professional figures: create a gig and specify how many people you need for each category (by opening a "Poet" position, you can specify the number of people who will be accepted to fill it), so you can receive participation requests and choose who you think is right for you.</p>
        
        <p>If, instead, you\'re planning your tour, search for gigs in the cities that interest you and ask to participate in events!</p>',
